## Project description

The goal of this project is to use data wrangling, cleaning, and manipulation techniques using Pandas and analyze the clean dataset using MySQL queries. 

We worked on a dataset on access to primary education in 87 countries.

We used common cleaning techniques in Python.

We then exported our clean table to MySQL and prepared a set of queries to make our data speak.

We used Matplotlib to plot country-level and region-level graphs.

We summarized the process in JIRA and GitHub.
